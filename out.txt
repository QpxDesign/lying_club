https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Work Arrangements

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:It is Amtrak’s policy that management employees work onsite four or five days a week depending on the needs of the business, as explained in Amtrak’s Work Arrangement Policy, P/I 7.41. More in-person work helps raise our performance and drives the level of transformation that our customers need, and our stakeholders expect. Further, we all benefit when we are closer to our business. We exist to take care of our customers. With being onsite, we are closer to both our customers and our frontline employees, who deliver on our customer service promise in our stations, on our trains, and in our yards and crew bases. 

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Mobile Work Arrangement

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:In some instances, Amtrak may determine that a position needs to be designated as Mobile because the primary responsibilities require substantial travel to a variety of Amtrak and non-Amtrak sites, averaging travel time of 50 percent or more, but without any one location being dominant. Such positions may require onsite presence at client or partner locations and/or involve fieldwork or site inspections. When not traveling, the work should be performed from the employee’s Assigned Worksite (generally an Amtrak location). 

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Remote Work Arrangement

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:In very limited circumstances, if Amtrak approves a remote position, this means that the individual is expected to work from a non- Amtrak U.S. location, such as the individual’s home, without scheduled days at an Amtrak work location. Travel is expected to be minimal (0-5%). 

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Remote Optional

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Remote Required

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Remote Work Rules

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:When working remotely, employees must ensure the following:

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Work remotely from a U.S. location such as the employee’s home or another non-Amtrak U.S. location. The remote location must be within the contiguous United States. 

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Use of a dedicated workspace that is used exclusively for performing Amtrak work.

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Access to reliable high-speed internet, and smart phone service capabilities.

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:Tax Implications for Remote Optional Positions

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:With regard to tax withholdings, please review the following information. Employees working as Remote Optional are working remotely from their Remote Work Location (U.S. location such as their home) at their own convenience and are assigned to an Amtrak worksite. As such, consistent with IRS guidelines, travel from an employee’s Remote Work Location to their Assigned Worksite is considered “commute” and the employee will be taxed on any reimbursement of eligible commuting costs (eligibility determined by Amtrak’s travel reimbursement policy). Under Amtrak policy, Amtrak will gross up (i.e., add an amount to your pay to cover any additional income tax that you owe) on reimbursement of travel expenses if they result in taxable income to you in two instances: New Employee Orientation and Leadership Summit. 

https://careers.amtrak.com/content/Applicant-Information-/?locale=en_US:There are several jurisdictions that follow a “convenience of employer” rule. Under this rule, an employee working for an employer whose office is located in one state, but who performs their work from a remote location in another state, is subject to the tax laws of their employer’s state unless the work arrangement is done for the convenience of the employer. If an employee can choose to work remotely (i.e., they are not required to work remotely by their employer), they would still be subject to tax in the employer’s state. The employee may also be subject to tax in the remote location state if that state imposes an income tax. As a result, individuals working for employers located in states that have adopted the convenience of employer rule are often subject to double taxation (i.e., they must pay income taxes in their resident state as well as their employer’s state). However, many states allow a credit for taxes paid to other states to reduce the potential of double taxation. Amtrak does not provide tax advice to its employees on this or any other matter. Consult your tax advisor if you have any questions in these situations or on any related matter.
